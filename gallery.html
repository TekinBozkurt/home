        <h3>Mona Lisa</h3>
        <p class="artist">Artist: Leonardo Da Vinci</p>
        <p class="description">Da Vinci's appealing portrait, painted between 1503 and 1517, has been haunted by two questions since its creation: What is the subject's name, and why is she smiling? Several explanations have been proposed over the years to explain the former: That she's the wife of Florentine trader Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo (hence the work's other title, La Gioconda); that she's Leonardo's mother, Caterina, conjured from Leonardo's boyhood memories of her; and that it's a self-portrait in drag. For generations, people have been fascinated by that famed smile's enigmatic charm. Whatever the reason, Mona Lisa's serene expression corresponds to the idealized countryside behind her, which fades into the distance thanks to Leonardo's use of atmospheric perspective.</p>
